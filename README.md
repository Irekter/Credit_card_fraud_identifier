â€¢	Credit Card Fraud prediction (https://github.com/Irekter/Credit_card_fraud_identifier): Python  
  o	Given an imbalanced dataset where fraud transactions are 0.001 to 1 legit transaction.  
  o	Implemented for different classifiers, kNN, SVM, Random Forest, Logistic regression, and Neural networks to identify the best possible model.  
  o	Implemented t-SNE dimension reduction to identify best variables that could help better identify fraud transactions.  
  o	Via undersampling, I trained the above-mentioned models and calculated Accuracy, recall, precision and F1 score to get the best model for this business problem.  
  o	Plotted training vs validation graphs to identify point of convergence for a model.  
  o	Libraries used were sklearn, keras, Pandas, seaborn.
